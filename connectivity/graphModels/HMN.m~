    Constucts Hierierchical modular networks by process outlined by
    Moretti + Munoz Nature Comms 2013 (https://doi.org/10.1038/ncomms3521)

    Inputs:
        HMtype (integer): Whether to construct HMN-1 (HMtype = 1) which has
            inter-modular connections determined by level-dependendent
            probability p, or HMN-2 (HMtype = 2) which has inter-moduli
            connections that have a deterministic number of level dependent
            connections
        M0     (integer): Number of nodes in fully connected modules (low
        le
        

    Outputs: 
        adjMat: adjacency matrix of hierirachical modular network
