%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% Kirchhoff's Voltage Law.
%
% ARGUMENTS: 
% Connectivity -- Structure that contains the adjacency matrix and its
%                 properties. The graph described by the adjacency matrix 
%                 is said to have V vertices and E edges.
% contact -- (2 x 1) row vector vector with the indices of the vertices 
%            between which the external voltage is applied:
%            contact(1)--(V_ext)--contact(2). 
%            The first contact is biased by the external voltage with 
%            respect to the second one. The seocond contact is always 
%            considered as ground (0 V).
% use_parfor -- flag to enable/disable the use of the parfor
%               by default it does not use it.
%
% OUTPUT: 
% eqMat -- |E|-|V|+2 linearly independent KVL equations, represented as a
%          (|E|-|V|+2)x(|E|+1) matrix. This is also termed the circuit 
%          matrix. The KVL cycles are chosen such that there is *exactly one*
%          cycle containing the external source. The equation that
%          originates from this cycle is always placed at the **last** row.
%          The extra column is due to an added tester resistor connected in 
%          series to the external voltage source and to the network.
%
% CONVENTIONS:
% 1. Branches are directed from low to high vertex index.
%    (i) --->---(j) if i < j.
% 2. The orientation of the branch with the tester resistor is from 
%    (i=contact(2)) --->--- (j=contact(1)) regardless whether i < j or 
%    j > i. So, the braanch leaves contact(2) and enters contact(1).
% 3. The quantity that is integrated along each cycle is the potential 
%    gradient (not minus the gradient), so when an edge is traveresed 
%    **against** its orientation, this is represented in the equation as a 
%    **plus** sign, and vice-versa. 
%    This is important only for the last equation.
% 4. The last equation is the only non-homogeneous equation in the
%    set, as it's the only one containing the externally applied voltage. 
%    The externally applied voltage always appears in the RHS without a 
%    sign change. This implies that this cycle must be traversed in a 
%    specific direction (anticlockwise):
%
%    contact(2)-->--through_the_network-->--contact(1)-->--through_the_source-->--contact(2)
