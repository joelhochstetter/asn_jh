% ARGUMENTS: 
% time vector - should have an even length
% signal - to be transformed

    freqSignal = fftshift(fft(signal));                     % perform fft and shift
    freqSignal = abs(freqSignal).^2/(L*Fs);                         % Normalize and calculate power spectrum (no complex numbers)

    freqSignal = freqSignal(L/2:end);                       % given that the signal is real, one side is enough
    freqSignal(2:end) = 2*freqSignal(2:end);                % double it (only the zero frequency doesn't appear twice)

    freqVector = Fs*(0:(L/2))'/L;                            % construction of frequency axis
